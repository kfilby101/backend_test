This is my first real project with Go and it was an exciting change of pace for me to learn something new and how to apply it. I had a lot of fun working on this. 

This was done with Go version 1.18.2. If Go is installed on your device, all you should have to do to run it is navigate to the directory via terminal and use "go run .". The API has the two listed endpoints, one for Process Receipts and one for getting the number of points. 

Process Receipts is /receipts/process

Get Points is /receipts/:id/points



This program does not have strong error checking, so if it's given junk data, the information won't be correct.
